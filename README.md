# Autonomous-Architecture
## Term Project
Design of an autonomous architecture for a shuttle vehicle to operate in smart Columbus

## Project Statement
Obtaining the longitudinal and lateral dynamics parameters for an autonomous shuttle vehicle, by choosing localization and perception sensors, and computer system for control and decision making.

## Key Features
* **Low level longitudinal control**: Building a simulink longitudinal model for the vehicle to demonstrate following of desired speed limits
* **Low Level Lateral Control**: Building a simulink lateral model for the vehicle to demonstrate path following
* **Path Planning and following**: Using the previous models to demonstrate maintaining a desired speed while following a larger closed path by the vehicle
* **Collision Avoidance and State Flow Decision Making**: Developing a simulink model to demonstrate collision avoidance and a stateflow finite state machine to illustrate decision making and control
